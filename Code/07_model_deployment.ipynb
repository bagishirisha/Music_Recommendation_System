    "Collaborative Filtering helps suggest songs you might like by looking at what other people who like the same music listen to.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 7.2.1.1 User-based Collaborative Filtering\n",
    "- **What it does**: It’s like getting song recommendations from a friend who has similar taste in music. The system finds other users who like what you like and suggests songs they enjoy.\n",
    "- **Why it’s good**: It’s personalized — you get suggestions that fit your own music taste.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 7.2.1.2 Item-based Collaborative Filtering\n",
    "- **What it does**: If you like a specific song, this method finds other songs that fans of that song also like and recommends them to you.\n",
    "- **Why it’s good**: It’s reliable because it doesn’t depend much on changing user preferences; it focuses on the songs themselves.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note**: Both methods need a lot of data about what songs people listen to work well.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 7.2.2. Content-Based Filtering\n",
    "\n",
    "This method recommends songs by looking at the features of the songs themselves.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Example**: If you like songs with lots of guitar or a specific beat, the system will find other songs with similar music features and recommend them to you.\n",
    "- **Why it’s useful**: It gives you songs that match the musical styles you like, without needing to know what others like.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 7.2.3. Hybrid Models\n",
    "\n",
    "Hybrid models mix both collaborative and content-based methods to give you better song recommendations.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **How it works**: These models use both what you like and what songs are like to make suggestions. This way, even if there’s not a lot of data on what you’ve listened to, you can still get good recommendations.\n",
    "- **Why it’s beneficial**: It helps fill in the gaps when there’s limited information about user preferences or new songs, making sure you still get recommendations that you are likely to enjoy.\n"

    "\n",
    "After analyzing our datasets, `genre_data_cleaned.csv` and `data_cleaned.csv`, we need to decide on the most suitable recommendation model based on the characteristics of each dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 7.3.1 Dataset Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Genre Data (`genre_data_cleaned.csv`)\n",
    "This dataset provides extensive descriptive metadata about songs, which includes:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Audio Features**: Metrics such as acousticness, danceability, energy, and instrumentalness.\n",
    "- **Categorical Data**: Attributes like genre, popularity category, and mode category, which describe the emotional and stylistic characteristics of the songs.\n",
    "- **Artist and Song Information**: Details on the artists and individual tracks.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Appropriate Model**: Given the rich content-based features, this dataset is ideal for a **Content-Based Filtering** recommendation system.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Data Cleaned (`data_cleaned.csv`)\n",
    "This dataset includes:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Song Features**: Contains attributes similar to the genre dataset, such as acousticness, danceability, and energy.\n",
    "- **Lack of User-Specific Interaction Data**: It does not contain user-item interactions like ratings or play history, which are crucial for collaborative filtering.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Appropriate Model**: The absence of user interaction data makes this dataset less suited for collaborative filtering and more appropriate for a **Content-Based Filtering** approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "**Model Choice**\n",
    "- The extensive details in the `data_cleaned.csv` make it ideal for analyzing and recommending songs based on their inherent characteristics.\n",
    "- We will proceed with a **Content-Based Filtering** model using the rich metadata available in our datasets.\n",
    "- **Technique**\n",
    "- We will implement **Cosine Similarity** to identify and recommend songs with similar features, aiming to improve user satisfaction by aligning recommendations closely with their preferences.\n"
